Face Detection App:-
A simple Python project that detects faces in real-time using your webcam with OpenCV.

Features:-
1. Real-time face detection
2.Lightweight and easy to run
3.Uses OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade model

Installation:-

1. Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-app.git
       cd face-detection-app
2.Install dependencies:
       pip install opencv-python

Usage:-
1. Run the script:
       python face_detection.py
*A window will open showing your webcam feed.
*Faces will be highlighted with rectangles.
*Press Q to quit.

Project Structure:-
face-detection-app/
│── face_detection.py   # Main script
│── README.md           # Documentation

Notes:-
1.Works best in well-lit environments.
2.You can experiment with other Haar cascade models (eyes, smiles, etc.).

Future Improvements:-
1.Save detected faces automatically
2.Add face recognition
3.Build a simple GUI
